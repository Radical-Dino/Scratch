#Nanonauts

https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/208580764/

We got a coding book from a bookstore.
This project was supposed to be coded in JavaScript.
But I did not have the applications to do it.
So, I made this project in Scratch.

In the game, you will have to jump or duck to not get hit by the incoming robots.
