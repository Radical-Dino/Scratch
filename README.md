# Scratch
I started to learn Scratch when I was 6 years old.
I found it very fun as I could create different games.

# About the projects
[Nanonauts](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/120165718/):
This project was from a book that taught JavaScript.
Since I did not have the applications to code it in Javascript, I made this project in Scratch.

The project turned out pretty well.
I even added my own things to the game.

In the game, you will have to jump or duck to not get hit by the incoming robots.
